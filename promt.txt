Check-in kiosk

Picture going to the doctor's office and replacing the receptionist and paper forms
with a kiosk similar to checking in for a flight.

There should be an account association flow where a doctor can authenticate using
their drchrono account and set up the kiosk for their office.

After the doctor is logged in, a page should be displayed that lets patients check
in. A patient with an appointment should first confirm their identity (first/last
name maybe SSN) then be able to update their demographic information using the
patient chart API endpoint.  Once the they have filled out that information the
app can set the appointment status to "Arrived" (Appointment API Docs).

The doctor should also have their own page they can leave open that displays
today’s appointments, indicating which patients have checked in and how long they
have been waiting. From this screen, the doctor can indicate they are seeing a
patient, which stops the “time spent waiting” clock. The doctor should also see
the overall average wait time for all patients they have ever seen.

Outside of these base requirements, you are free to develop any features you think
make sense.

To begin, fork the empty drchrono API project repo at https://github.com/drchrono/api-example-django

Use the drchrono API docs and feel free to reach out to me with any questions and
I'll get back to you ASAP.
